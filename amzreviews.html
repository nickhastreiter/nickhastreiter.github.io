 <h1>Ever wanted to tell the 1% to fuck off?</h1>
           <p> Read on. This project has one goal: to stop any of the 1% from reaching their wet dream of becoming the world's first trillionaire.</p><h2>How you may ask?</h2>

           <p>We're going to make me the world's first trillionaire before they can get there. Curious? First let's cover a couple of concepts you may or may not already be familiar with: <strong>market cap</strong> and <strong>liquidity</strong>.</p>

           <h2>Market Cap</h2>
          <p>Market cap is the product of (<strong>unit price</strong> * <strong># of units</strong>). If there are 10,000,000 shares of a company and the last market trade was at $10, it's market cap is $100,000,000. Easy enough right?</p>

          <h2>Liquidity</h2>
          <p>Liquidity refers to the volume of units being traded. A market that moves a high amount of volume relative to it's total size can be considered to have a deep liquidity pool. An easier way to think of it is how long it will take to have a buyer lined up when the time comes to sell.</p>

            <h1>What are you getting at?</h1>
            <p>I'll come back to that in a moment... let me tell you about TrillionChain.</p>
            <p>With this project I am hoping to propel myself forward as the world's first trillionaire, bypassing all these snobby "I built an empire" folks straight to the top.</p>
            <h1>Yeah that's right, we're going to mint the world's first trillionaire.</h1>

            <p>I've created a cryptocurrency named TrillionChain with the symbol "T". When I created TrillionChain with a total of 1,000,001,000,000 tokens, one trillion of which I assigned to my own address. </p>
            <p>The remaining tokens is where you come into play. Buy a token from me and you will be flipping the bird to Mark Zuckerburg. Buy ten and you've got Buffett's blood boiling. A hundred or more and you ca </p>


            <h2> OK OK OK... if you haven't put the pieces together yet here's how you can help</h2>
            <p>I set a casual goal to be the world's first trillionaire. That's why I created this project. You see, I currently own over one trillion T tokens. This means if someone buys one of my tokens from me, I'm sitting on an asset with a market value of over a trillion dollars.</p>
            <p>Will you help me show these measly billionaires that it isn't all about how many digits they can stack in their fiat bank accounts? Buy some trillionaire tokens, and together we'll succeed.</p>

 <h2 style="color:black;">Stand up against the man!</h2><button class="makeatrillionaire">Make me a trillionaire today</button>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</div>
            <p>By purchasing <u>T</u> you're hitting the world's measly billionaires where it hurts them the most... right in the ego.</p><br><br>
            <h2> How does this all work?</h2><br>
            <div style ="text-align: left;"><p>Let's start from the beginning. I have created a new cryptocurrency like so many scammy ICO artists have done before me. Here are the specifications of <u>T</u>rillionChain:</p>
            <ul><li>1,000,001,000,000 tokens in circulation</li>
                <li>1,000,000,000,000 (99.9999%) of these tokens are assigned to my personal address</li>
                <li>1,000,000 (wow that number seems tiny) are for sale</li>
                <li style="color: red;">I will do no work to increase the value of this token -- it is not an investment and <strong>most definitely not a security</strong>... think of it like buying a collectable rock, if it goes up in value it's only because people are hard for rocks, not because god made the rock more valuable</li>
            </ul>

  <br> <p> Did you see that hangtime?? You could have carved a turkey before I landed. I have long been known as a fruit ninja for my machete skills. My point is this:</p><p><strong>Don't lose faith because I'm working solo on this project. I'm fully dedicated to becoming the world's first trillionaire from this website.</strong></p>

<h2>Wow - that token sounds... lackluster</h2>
<p> I couldn't agree more. But this actually isn't about the technology. It's about the economics and market forces.</p>
<p> Consider for a moment that almost every egocentric billionaire on the planet has the vast majority of their net worth tied up in illiquid assets. This means their entire net worth is based strictly on what the market said the last share of their assets were worth.</p>
<h2>Woah woah woah wait a minute... stocks are liquid assets!</h2>
<p>Right. For you and I, stocks are liquid assets. But for someone like Jeff Bezos who holds $120,000,000,000 worth of Amazon stock, it's anything but liquid.</p>
<p>Imagine for a second what would happen if Bezos wanted to liquidly turn his stock into cash. (Calls his sleezy broker who knows how to get money out of anybody)</p><br>
   <div style="text-align:left;"> <p>Jeff: Hey Donald, how's the oval office?</p>
    <p>Donald: This is the most beautiful office in the world. I told my people I want a beautiful office and that's what I'm going to get. This office is so beautiful I have Oprah c....</p>
    <p>Jeff: Right, Donald I need you to line up a buyer for my stake in Amazon</p>
    <p>Donald: I'm gonna find you the best buyer, they're gonna be perf...</p>
    <p>Jeff: Thanks Donald.</p>
