 <h1>Ever wanted to tell the 1% to fuck off?</h1>
           <p> Read on. This project has one goal: to stop any of the 1% from reaching their wet dream of becoming the world's first trillionaire.</p><h2>How you may ask?</h2>

           <p>We're going to create world's first trillionaire before they can get there. Curious? First let's cover a couple of concepts you may or may not already be familiar with: <strong>market cap</strong> and <strong>liquidity</strong>.</p>

           <h2>Market Cap</h2>
          <p>Market cap is the product of (<strong>market price per unit</strong> * <strong>total # of units</strong>). If there are 10,000,000 shares of a company and the last market trade was at $10, it's market cap is $100,000,000. Easy enough right?</p>
          <p>Even if the price has been $0.01 for the last five years, if someone comes along and makes a purchase on the open market for $10, the market cap is $100,000,000.</p><p> That means if you've been holding 100,000 shares that have only been worth $1k for the last 5 years, and someone buys one share for $10 on open market, your shares are suddenly worth $1,000,000. How's it feel to be a millionaire?</p>

          <h2>Liquidity</h2>
          <p>Liquidity refers to the volume of units being traded. A market that moves a high amount of volume relative to it's total size can be considered to have a deep pool of liquidity. An easier way to think of it is how long it will take to have a buyer lined up and how much the order will affect the market price when the time comes to sell.</p>

            <h1>What are you getting at?</h1>
            <p>I'll come back to that in a moment... let me tell you about my ambitions for TrillionChain.</p>
            <p>With this project I am hoping to propel myself forward as the world's first trillionaire, bypassing all these snobby "I built an empire" folks straight to the top.</p>
            <h1>Yeah that's right, we're going to mint the world's first trillionaire.</h1>

            <p>I've created a cryptocurrency named TrillionChain with the symbol "T". TrillionChain was created with a total of 1,000,001,000,000 tokens, one trillion of which I assigned to my own address. </p>
            <p>The remaining tokens is where you come into play. Buy a token from me and you will be flipping the bird to Mark Zuckerburg. Buy ten and you've got Buffett's blood boiling. A hundred or more and you ca </p>


            <h2> OK OK OK... if you haven't put the pieces together yet here's how you can help</h2>
            <p>I set a casual goal to be the world's first trillionaire. That's why I created this project. You see, I currently own over one trillion T tokens. This means if someone buys one of my tokens from me, I'm sitting on an asset with a market value of over a trillion dollars.</p>
            <p>Will you help me show these measly billionaires that it isn't all about how many digits they can stack in their fiat bank accounts? Buy some trillionaire tokens, and together we'll succeed.</p>

 <h2 style="color:black;">Stand up against "the man"!</h2>
 <button class="makeatrillionaire">Make a Trillionaire</button>


            <p>By purchasing <u>T</u> you're hitting the world's measly billionaires where it hurts them the most... right in the ego.</p><br><br>
            <h2> How does this all work?</h2><br>
            <div style ="text-align: left;"><p>Let's start from the beginning. I have created a new cryptocurrency like so many scammy ICO artists have done before me. Here are the specifications of <u>T</u>rillionChain:</p>
            <ul><li>1,000,001,000,000 tokens in circulation</li>
                <li>1,000,000,000,000 (99.9999%) of these tokens are assigned to my personal address</li>
                <li>1,000,000 (wow that number seems tiny) are for sale</li>
                <li style="color: red;">I will do no work to increase the value of this token -- it is not an investment and <strong>most definitely not a security</strong>... think of it like buying a collectable rock, if it goes up in value it's only because people are hard for rocks, not because god made the rock more valuable</li>
            </ul>

<h2>Wow - that token sounds... lackluster</h2>
<p> I couldn't agree more. But this actually isn't about the technology. It's about the economics and market forces.</p>
<p> Consider for a moment that almost every egocentric billionaire on the planet has the vast majority of their net worth tied up in illiquid assets. This means their entire net worth is based strictly on what the market said the last share of their assets were worth.</p>
<h2>Woah woah woah wait a minute... stocks are liquid assets!</h2>
<p>Right. For you and I, stocks are liquid assets. But for someone like Jeff Bezos who holds $130,000,000,000 worth of Amazon stock, it's anything but liquid.</p>
<p>Imagine for a second what would happen if Bezos wanted to turn his AMZN into cash. He'd get on the phone with his Edward Jones broker (ha right) and place a sell order for $130,000,000,000.</p> 
<p>Three different things would happen here:</p>
<ul><li>The sell order would crash the price to literally $.01 or less. It's extremely unlikely ANYONE has $120,000,000,000 in cash ready to inject into the market, much less one stock that the founder, CEO and largest shareholder happens to be dumping (bringing me to the next point)</li>
    <li>Panic would ensue... why is Jeff Bezos dumping every share of his company???</li>
    <li>Panic would be amplified... "holy shit there's $130B of selling pressure on this stock, I'm out!"</li>
</ul>
<h2>A goldfish may not make waves in your big pond, but a breeching blue whale would...</h2>
<p>At the time of writing Bezos owns $81.the average daily volume of AMZN is $8.57B. That means it would take Bezos 15.2 days to sell all of his stock
